# human_activity_recognizer.

The codes here does not hava dataset folder because it is large but you can find it here

https://www.kaggle.com/jithinnambiarj/human-activity-detection-dataset/tasks?taskId=4068

and after downloaidng it we combined the content of acitvity dataset and activity vaidation
in our folder called Activity_Dataset because we make the traning and testing set our selves not as
the code is downloaded like.

the toturial followed writing codes for recognize.py was from here

https://learnopencv.com/introduction-to-video-classification-and-human-activity-recognition/

because of large size of dataset which is about (3GB) used in the above toturial thats why we
find the dataset our selves.
